# CAD-CAM-2.5D-milling-technology
CAD/CAM software used to mill certain part. First  the part is designed and then a real existing mill machine is added through the technology database icon in SolidWorks. After that the CAM software performs the  processing operation and mills/contours/drills the material that is not part of the working piece. When the part is finished, we can simulate and simulate the result and then generate the G-code with the post process icon.
